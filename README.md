# Skeet Overview
Welcome to my Weather API!  This program is a website that practices using a weather API. I made this website to specifically practice using localStorage as well as to practice fetching a API and displaying the data. The weather images and number are what comes from the API itself(Note the images displayed come with the API and are not the best).  The tempature is displayed in Ferihieght and had to be converted from Kelvin.
